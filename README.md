# section-sign-up

## Rules
- Read through the weeks material before the meeting
- Sign-up to present a section

## Presenting
**Present/Presentation** Does not mean slides (unless you want to do that). The format is to share your screen, open the book to the section you are presenting and likely have some of the book's sample code in an editor to do a walkthrough when that is helpful. 

- Lessons (books term for chapters) will be divided-up into parts that are small enough to be presented in 15 minutes or so.
- If the group lingers on a section and doesn't get to all the planned presentations the remainder will be moved to the next week.
- If you don't fully understand the part you are presenting that is fine. You can lead the group through it as a discussion.

How you "present" you part of the lesson is really up to you. Anything from explaining key points in detail, code walk-throughs to guiding the group in a discussion is good.

## Sign-up

**(edit this file directly)**
